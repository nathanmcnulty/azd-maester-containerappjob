- **Schema version:** 1.0.0

## MCAJ-001: Reconcile this backlog with current source and active work

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** done
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Plans and implementation evidence are spread across files; the captured source can change while other tasks work.

**Scope:**

- docs/backlog.json
- docs/backlog.md
- Existing roadmap, execution status, open issues and pull requests &lpar;read-only&rpar;

**Acceptance:**

- Classify each candidate as implemented, still open, superseded or awaiting evidence; retain source links and reasons.
- Inspect dirty state, remotes, worktrees and local environment presence without reading secrets; avoid duplicate work with active owners.
- Resolve the actual offline validation commands and record exact current default-branch/working-tree provenance; do not copy historical live passes to newer code.

**Validation:**

- git status --short
- git remote -v
- git worktree list --porcelain
- Read the applicable instructions and validation workflow; read gh issue list and gh pr list for the named repository using nathanmcnulty. Do not create or modify issues/PRs.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- _none_

**Sources:**

- README.md

**Evidence:**

- Reconciled later reviewed metadata tip 2a6bbcbc81bd0600ea4665d99368ba532c4ac8dd against freshly fetched origin/main 6288ccefab8faba0b54b85be9fb3a2ec3230c45a. Current main adds reviewed source fixes from pull request&lpar;s&rpar; &num;16, &num;17, &num;19 and &num;21; no dirty canonical bytes or unrelated branch history were copied.
- Current repository issues and pull requests were read on 2026-10-04&colon; none are open. Items MCAJ-002, MCAJ-003 remain proposed because their component, host-specific live, or shared azd-maester issue gates are not satisfied by source merges alone; completed issue-backed fixes retain exact issue and pull-request evidence.
- Full current-source offline Pester validation passed 43/43 tests with zero failures. Canonical backlog schema and generated-Markdown checks also passed; no Azure, Graph, deployment, report publication or other live operation was performed.

**Review and authorization note:**

Review MCAJ-001 against the current repository state. Its status or authorization class is not eligible for an actionable generated handoff. Do not claim or execute it without explicit selection, satisfied dependencies, and every required authorization. Never interpret this generated view as approval.

## MCAJ-006: Pin custom image base packages and deploy the resolved image digest

- **Kind:** discovery
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** done
- **Wave:** 0
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

The report captured on 2026-10-03 is closed after the reviewed fix merged; this record preserves the original trigger and validation boundary.

**Scope:**

- Linked issue and current source &lpar;read-only&rpar;
- Repository-local backlog evidence

**Acceptance:**

- Read the linked issue and current default branch; classify the exact defect, current owner and evidence gap.
- Record a current PR or verified resolution before selecting any implementation; preserve broader feature and live acceptance gates.

**Validation:**

- Read current issue and PR state using nathanmcnulty; do not modify or close issues during reconciliation.
- Inspect dirty state and worktrees; resolve the exact current revision and relevant offline commands before implementation.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- _none_

**Sources:**

- https&colon;//github.com/nathanmcnulty/azd-maester-containerappjob/issues/12

**Evidence:**

- GitHub issue &num;12 is closed by merged pull request &num;14; current origin/main 6288ccefab8faba0b54b85be9fb3a2ec3230c45a contains the reviewed fix. Source closure does not claim a new live deployment, report publication, or human-visible result.

**Review and authorization note:**

Review MCAJ-006 against the current repository state. Its status or authorization class is not eligible for an actionable generated handoff. Do not claim or execute it without explicit selection, satisfied dependencies, and every required authorization. Never interpret this generated view as approval.

## MCAJ-004: Maester invocation errors can become successful container jobs with fabricated reports

- **Kind:** maintenance
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** done
- **Wave:** 1
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

The report captured on 2026-10-03 is closed after the reviewed fix merged; this record preserves the original trigger and validation boundary.

**Scope:**

- Paths and trigger cited in the linked issue
- Focused offline regression tests
- docs/
- docs/backlog.json
- docs/backlog.md
- BACKLOG.md

**Acceptance:**

- Classify the report as still reproducible, already fixed, superseded or requiring live evidence; record the exact current revision.
- For a reproducible defect, demonstrate the linked trigger with an offline regression and apply the smallest fix preserving tenant/target/ownership and failure semantics.
- For a feature, produce a bounded design with compatibility, optional permissions, acceptance and rollout gates before implementation; no live mutation or automatic issue closure.

**Validation:**

- Read the issue body and current source/PRs; capture the exact reproduction and existing registered offline validation command.
- Use deterministic fixtures for the described trigger and negative boundary; retain current-source results. Do not rerun production or tenant operations to reproduce it.

## MCAJ-003: Reconcile shared hook/webapp versions and host permission deltas

- **Kind:** maintenance
- **Priority:** P2
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 1
- **Authorization:** local-only
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Existing adoption must be updated through hashes and host-specific validation rather than blindly reinstalling components.

**Scope:**

- azd-components.lock.json
- azd-permissions.json
- scripts/
- infra/
- docs/

**Acceptance:**

- Compare lock pins with canonical manifests and current-source drift before proposing an update.
- Run target-context negative cases and compare minimal versus optional-feature permissions.
- Keep Maester execution and reporting host-specific; record exact source hashes and candidate/pilot status.

**Validation:**

- Invoke-Pester ./tests/TargetContext.Tests.ps1 -CI
- Read and compare lock hashes with canonical reference source; do not overwrite drift.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- maester-azd-hooks
- maester-report-webapp

**Sources:**

- README.md
- azd-components.lock.json

**Evidence:**

## MCAJ-002: Qualify Container Apps Job execution and optional report-webapp lifecycle

- **Kind:** verification
- **Priority:** P1
- **Status:** proposed
- **Wave:** 2
- **Authorization:** azure-deployment
- **Blocker:** _none_
- **Claim:** _none_

**Problem:**

Shared pilots are already vendored; host-specific execution and report access still need independently bound evidence.

**Scope:**

- scripts/Invoke-JobValidation.ps1
- docs/
- infra/
- tests/TargetContext.Tests.ps1

**Acceptance:**

- Record exact Maester/runtime/component revisions and host execution output under the selected tenant.
- Validate optional webapp identity, report publishing, Easy Auth and feature-specific permission delta.
- Disabled web hosting works independently; cleanup preserves adopted objects and records exact owned resources.

**Validation:**

- Invoke-Pester ./tests/TargetContext.Tests.ps1 -CI
- After separate authorization use ./scripts/Invoke-JobValidation.ps1 against the exact owned host; retain report access and cleanup evidence.

**Dependencies:**

- _none_

**Components:**

- maester-azd-hooks
- maester-report-webapp

**Sources:**

- README.md
- scripts/Invoke-JobValidation.ps1

**Evidence:**

- _none_

**Review and authorization note:**

Review MCAJ-002 against the current repository state. Its status or authorization class is not eligible for an actionable generated handoff.
